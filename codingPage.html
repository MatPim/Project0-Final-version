        <h2>How did I become a coder?</h2>
        <label>I started coding last year, begining in this coding world with C#, after this amazing experience, I decided to go to JS, and I learn this tecnology and love it. In this point my thirst of knowledge was just rising and I needed to learn some front-end to my screen to interect with my code, so I decided learn HTML and CSS. After all it I was excited for more content about coding, so I decided to improve my JS, learning ES6 with Node.js. This was a little bit of my impressive experience, so later I didn't stop to learn coding, and now I'm here, doing a Haravard course of web programming.</label>
